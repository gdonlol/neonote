## Description

CS3307 Group 14

Beautiful, fast, and fully featured text editor in the terminal for users who wish to keep their workflow in one place. This project will incorporate planning features similar to Notion to streamline personal productivity but be optimized for terminal use with a graphical TUI (text-based user interface). The text editor will integrate tools for task management, calendar scheduling, and more, while being optimized for a keyboard-driven workflow in a terminal environment.

This software will be developed in C++ and will run virtually on a Raspberry Pi. We do not require a physical Raspberry Pi kit for this project.

## Features

### Required Features

-   Rich text editing (bold, italic, color, without markdown syntax) – if this is too hard, we go just plain text editor
-   Custom file format
-   Keyboard user-centric, efficient keybinds for everything
-   Easy creation of tables
-   Todo lists for productivity
-   Kanban board
-   Calendars for event planning
-   Interface for list of pages on sidebar

### Optional Features

-   Widgets like clock, weather, ASCII art, PC hardware stats, animated matrix, etc.
-   Startup options in arguments, for users to automatically open a widget, for example, on startup
-   Password-locked pages
-   File system where users can make nested structures, like pages within pages
-   Linking between pages, like a wiki
-   Man page/help docs for keybinds

### Wish-list Features

-   Custom keybinds in config file
-   Custom color themes
-   UML diagram creation (unfeasible)
-   Custom plugin API for other devs/modders (unfeasible)
-   Live collaborative editing (unfeasible)

## Risks

-   **Potential complexity in managing multiple productivity tools.**

    -   _Mitigation:_ Modularize development and focus on core functionalities first.

-   **Potential performance issues with large tables or lists.**

    -   _Mitigation:_ Load and display only one section at a time.

-   **Integrating the graphical TUI with multiple productivity tools may lead to UI challenges.**

    -   _Mitigation:_ Frequent testing to ensure all elements integrate properly, and make sure that all features of the app are accessible with solely keyboard shortcuts.

-   **Keyboard shortcuts for navigation within graphical TUI may not be intuitive to design.**

    -   _Mitigation:_ Lots of live testing and add support for many popular muscle memory shortcuts, that provide the same result (e.g., `Alt + [number]` and `Ctrl + [number]` doing the same thing, that is, switching to tab `[number]`).

-   **Rich text editing without special formatting may be tricky to execute.**

    -   _Mitigation:_ Use vim-like controls, allowing users to enter different modes, like insert mode or normal mode, where normal mode allows for more keyboard shortcuts for rich text editing.

-   **Displaying rich text as plain text in insert mode.**

    -   _Mitigation:_ Code to handle a custom file format.

-   **Learning curve for advanced TUI programming and C++ libraries.**
    -   _Mitigation:_ Allocate extra time for training and experimentation, and pair less experienced members with those who have prior exposure to similar technologies.

## Other Notes

### File Format Ideas

-   **Custom binary** (best speed but might be hard)
    -   Store metadata in the first couple of bytes
    -   Store text as string blocks, where we have content and styles
    -   For parsing, we can either:
	-   Store the length of the block at the start of the block to prevent reading bytes outside of the range
        -   Use a special character as a null terminator
-   **Text edits should be made to memory**; the user writes to disk with a command/keyboard shortcut like Vim
-   **Example:**

	-   `"Hello"` = `0x05 0x48 0x65 0x6C 0x6C 0x6F 0x01`
        -   First byte: length to loop to parse the block
        -   Last byte: example style flag for bold (we can have a bunch of `0`s to represent flags that can be toggled on or off, or maybe represent styles in a different way)

-   **Json**
-   **Markdown**

## List of Libraries to Potentially Use

-   `ncurses` – for TUI implementation and keyboard shortcuts
-   `SQLite` – for storing and managing data locally in the text editor (for calendar events, task lists, etc.)
-   `chrono` – for keeping track of time for clock and timer features (if implemented)
-   System calls – for displaying PC stats/monitoring (RAM, CPU, disk space, uptime, etc.)
